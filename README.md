By following the steps outlined in this README, you will understand how to use and customize the Responsive University Website for your own educational institution.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
